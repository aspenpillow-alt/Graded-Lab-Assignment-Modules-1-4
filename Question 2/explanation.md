1. I created a directory named `documents` in my home directory to keep project-related files organized.

2. I navigated into the new directory and used the `touch` command to create an empty file named `plan.txt`.

3. I used the `echo` command to write a short project reminder into the `plan.txt` file.

4. I used the `ls -l` command to verify the file’s metadata, ensuring that I am the owner and that the file has the correct permissions.

5. I used the `cp` command to create an exact duplicate of the plan file as a backup.

6. I used the `mv` command to rename the main folder to `project_documents` to make the directory name more descriptive.

7. I created a subdirectory named `archive` inside the project folder to store older or backup files.

8. I moved the backup file `plan_copy.txt` into the `archive` folder using the `mv` command.

9. I used the `ls -R` command to display a recursive listing of all files and subdirectories within the project folder.

10. I used the `readlink -f` command to display the absolute path, which represents the full directory location of the archived file.
