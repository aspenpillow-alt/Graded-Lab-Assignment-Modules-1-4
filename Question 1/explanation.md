1. I used the `whoami` and `groups` commands to verify my user identity and the group memberships associated with my account on the system.

2. I used the `pwd` command to determine my current working directory and `ls -l` to view all files and directories in long-listing format.

3. I created the file `user_info.txt` using the `echo` command to confirm that my Linux user environment was set up correctly.

4. I used the `wc -c` command to count the number of characters in the file and ensure that the content was saved successfully.

5. I accessed the manual page for the `mkdir` command and identified the `-p` option, which allows parent directories to be created if they do not already exist.

6. I listed the contents of my home directory and used the `sort` command to arrange the output in alphabetical order.

7. I used the `grep` command to search the `log.txt` file and display only the lines containing the word “admin”.

8. I used the `uname -r` command to display the specific version of the Linux kernel currently running on the system.

9. I sent four ICMP packets to Google using the `ping` command to verify network connectivity.

10. I used the `uptime` command to check how long the system has been running, the number of logged-in users, and the current system load.
